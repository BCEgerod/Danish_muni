		\small \noindent \emph{Abstract:} Municipal governments supposedly empower citizens, giving them the ability to shape their local community based on their political beliefs. In spite of this, we know little about whether municipal government is actually responsive to the wishes of their electorate. In this study, we look at whether the policy implemented by local politicians actually respond to changes in the public mood. To do this, we compile a unique and comprehensive dataset of local fiscal policy, which we use to construct municipal-level estimates of fiscal policy conservatism. This detailed policy data is then linked to several measures of local ideological sentiment. We find strong evidence for dynamic responsiveness: if public opinion in a municipality changes, then public policy responds. We also look at whether single party control of the city council affects the level of responsiveness. We identify this effect using a close elections regression discontinuity design, comparing the responsiveness of city councils where the largest party narrowly won a majority of the seats with city councils where the largest party narrowly lost.

\section{Introduction}

In most developed countries municipal governments are an essential cog in the machinery of representative government. While they work within the framework of a national constitution and are generally subordinate to the central government, municipalities are, on average, responsible for a third of all public spending and, in most countries, they are able to levy taxes with little or no oversight \cite{oecd2016subnational}. In this way, they play a central part in the quintessential political act of deciding who gets what, when and how.  Yet until recently, we knew little about the extent to which municipal governments are actually responsive to their citizens preferences.


This changed with Tausanovitch and Warshaw's \citeyear{tausanovitch2014representation} recent influential study, which  was the first comprehensive examination of the responsiveness of city policy. In this study, \citeauthor{tausanovitch2014representation} used Multilevel Regression with Poststratification (MRP) to estimate the policy preferences of citizens in a cross section of all US cities with a population size of above 20,000, finding that there is a strong correlation between these preferences and city policy. Since the publication of this study, two other pieces of research has directly examined municipal responsiveness. The first of these are \cite{einstein2016pushing}. They also identify a strong correlation between citizen preferences, measured as support for the Democratic party at presidential elections,  and city policy in 2,000 midsize US cities. Other than replicating the findings from \citeauthor{tausanovitch2014representation}, \citeauthor{einstein2016pushing} are also able to identify the use of intergovernmental grants as a key mechanism underlying responsiveness (i.e., conservative cities are able to implement policies that differ from liberal cities because of these grants). They also offer a stronger identification strategy by identifying dynamic responsiveness \citep[cf.][]{stimson1995dynamic} in a panel of cities from two US states using a lagged dependent variable approach. In an unpublished study \cite{sances2017voters} expands on these findings using a panel of 3,000 US counties which spans the last 50 years. Linking changes in democratic vote share to county-level policy, \citeauthor{sances2017voters} finds that as counties grow more democratic they tend to spend more and collect more own-source revenues. This is even true within states, suggesting that the link between voter preferences and public policy are driven by local governments and not higher levels of government.

Aside from these studies, different strands of research has presented \textit{indirect} evidence that city policy might be responsive. For one, a number of recent studies have shown that voters tend to (re-)elect local politicians based on their actions in office \citep{arnold2012holding,burnett2017politics} and that voters tend to vote for conservative (liberal)  mayors if they themselves hold conservative (liberal) policy views  \citep{sances2017ideology,boudreau2015lost,hopkins2017retrospective}. Furthermore, a number of studies have found that it matters for city policy whether a conservative or liberal party controls the mayoralty and/or the city council \citep{fiva2016power,folke2014shades,blom2006parties,de2016mayoral}. 

%While these factors are necessary for the presence of municipal responsiveness, they are not sufficient. Even if voters tend to select politicians who share their ideological disposition, and even if these politicians tend to enact policies which reflect this disposition, these mechanisms need to operate in tandem, and be quite strong, in order to create responsiveness. If, for instance, politicians only have modest control over city policy, voters would need to send very strong policy signals through their vote in order for city policy to respond. 

All in all, research in the area of municipal reponsiveness has made impressive progress in the past few years, giving us evidence which strongly suggests that municipal governments are responsive to the concerns of their citizens. Even so, the existing evidence remains limited in different important ways.

For one, most of the existing studies, and \textit{all} the studies which study municipal responsiveness directly, focus exclusively on the US context. This puts into question whether voters are able constrain municipal policies in other contexts as well, or whether municipal responsiveness is a result of the particular features of the American political system. In relation to this, the existing studies all look at relatively large municipalities (\citealp{einstein2016pushing} has the smallest average municipal size of 40,000 inhabitants), making it unclear whether smaller municipalities, where politics is probably less professionalized, are responsive as well.

Furthermore, there seems to be a trade-off in the existing work between having good measures of city policy and voter preferences \citep[cf.]{tausanovitch2014representation} and having a stronger identification strategy \citep[cf.]{sances2017voters}. This is potentially problematic, as strong inferences about the extent of municipal responsiveness requires both high-quality measures and a convincing design.

Finally, existing work has primarily focused on identifying whether and when municipal responsiveness exists. As such, there is almost no causally persuasive work on whether certain municipal-level institutions can help promote (or depress) responsiveness.\footnote{\cite{tausanovitch2014representation} examines some interactions between different institutions and responsiveness, however, as they themselves recognize, these analyses suffer from substantial problems related to endogeneity.} 

In this study, we address these limitations related to context, design and data sources by studying responsiveness in Danish Municipalities. Danish municipalities are radically different from US counties and cities. They are small (average size 16,000), organized in general rather than special purpose governments \citep{berry2009imperfect}, lead by city councils which typically feature three or more parties, who are elected in a PR electoral system where turnout is relatively high. As such, if it is possible to identify responsiveness here as well as in the US, we can be pretty sure that municipal responsiveness is a relatively general phenomenon.

In order to identify responsiveness in this context, we develop an annual measure of municipal policy conservatives based on 14 fiscal policy indicators (1978-2006). A measure which is has much more comprehensive in terms of its granularity and the time period covered than the city policy measures used in previous studies. To measure the ideological sentiment in this time period, we use net support for conservative (right-wing) parties. Unlike previous studies, who have measured electoral sentiment using support for parties at national or regional elections, we are able to look at electoral support at \textit{local} elections dating back to 1970. (In a future iteration we will also use MRP estimates of citizen conservatism based on the Danish National Election Studies, however, we have not been able to do this yet.) These uniquely comprehensive data sources set makes it possible to  go beyond the trade-off between good measurement and a strong design which has characterized existing work. 



\section{Empirical Context: Danish Municipalities}	
Denmark is a decentralized welfare state where municipalities can affect their local revenue and set a yearly budget.  Municipal tasks and services include the core welfare services of the Danish welfare state and municipal spending amounts to 35 percent of GDP, which is more than half of all public spending.\footnote{The tasks include primary education, child care and care for elderly people, libraries, local sports facilities and other cultural activities, granting and payment of cash assistance, anticipatory pension and certain other social benefits, job activation and employment projects for unemployed persons (unemployment services), public utilities, environmental measures and emergency services.}


Danish municipalities are governed by small city councils (between 9 and 29 members) which are elected at proportional elections and with a multi-party system which, to a large extent, mirrors the party system at the national level \citep{blom2013et}. Elections are fixed to take place every four years and do not usually coincide with elections at the national or EU level. Turnout is high with an average of around 70 percent since 1970.  The work in the city council is structured by a a number of committees. The number and size of the committees is determined by the council. Committee membership is allocated proportionality between the political parties which means that there is broad political representation in all committees. The committees can decide on matters in their area and the administrative responsibility across areas is essentially divided. 

Following each municipal election, a majority in city council elects a mayor, and the chairmen of the various committees \citep{serritzlew2008explaining}. Mayors are the only full time professional politicians in the city councils and have a number of formal obligations \citep{kjaer2015urban}. Mayors are also responsible for the day-to-day business of the administration and chairs the important economic committee which sets taxes and the budget.


There have been two large municipal reforms in the last 50 years. The first was conducted in 1970 as the Danish welfare state started to expand. Here the number of municipalities were reduced from more than 1000 to 275.\footnote{In this study, we exclude the municipality of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg, as these were governed in a different way.} (Although it was 277 the first two years.) so that the municipalities were able to efficiently provide a more complex portfolio of public services \citep{ingvartsen1991kommunalreformen}. The second reform was conducted in 2007 and further reduced the number of municipalities from 275 to 98. Once again, the increasing complexity of public service provision was a key argument for the reform \citep{christiansen2008utaenkelige}. Since both of these reforms are so comprehensive, we let them be the bookends of our analysis, examining the relationship between citizens ideology and the ideological bent of city policy between the two reforms. Because of data availability we further censor the analysis to go between 1978 and 2008.

\section{An Annual Measure of Municipal Fiscal Policy Conservatism}
To measure fiscal policy conservatism in Danish municipalities we rely on 14 different indicators relating to either tax policy (3 indicators), spending policy (2), organization of public service delivery (3), co-payment for public services (4) or the extent of public services (2). While  spending and tax variables are commonly used in the literature, we are the first to include other types of variables in an analysis which is not simply cross-sectional. An overview of the policy indicators are presented in Table \ref{tab:policies}.

The included policies had to meet the following criteria: (1) The policy should be directly set by the city council.\footnote{Although it was included even if it was set in collaboration between the city council and some other  (set of) actor(s).} (2) It had to be a policy and not the outcome of a policy. (3) It had to be available for at least five years between 1978 and 2016. All policy information was retrieved from Statistics Denmark or the Danish Ministry for Economic Affairs and the Interior.

\input{table/measurement.tex}

It should be noted that for most of our variables, data is only available after 1993, however, they still shape our estimates of municipal fiscal policy conservatism across the entire period, because of the Bayesian latent variable techniques, we make use of when creating the measure (more on this below).Even so, variables with missing values supply less information to the estimation in periods, where we have no data on them. Thus, estimates for the period 1978-1992 are based mostly on our measures of income and property tax as well as spending pr. capita.\footnote{To make sure that our results are not driven by the inclusion of different variables at various points in time, we have run all models using only those three variables, which does not change any results substantively.}

%\textbf{Maybe for later or the appendix coupled with analysis of beta-parameters etc.:} Furthermore, estimates of fiscal conservatism, when including all items and only the three with full coverage are highly correlated. It seems that the main difference bres is that the posterior distribution of the measure including all items exhibits lower variance. Additionally, the three items with full coverage have the most discriminating power, as shown by their higher $\beta$'s. This indicates that we are able to capture important aspects of fiscal conservatism with those three items alone. The addition of the remaining 11 variables serves to improve the estimation mainly by decreasing posterior variance.etween the two measu

\subsection*{Estimating Fiscal Policy Conservatism}
We conceptualize fiscal conservatism as a latent trait driving municipal expenditures, and rely on Bayesian latent variable modeling to estimate it. We parameterize fiscal conservatism through the following measurement model, which allows us to estimate it across time and space:

\begin{gather*}
F_{itk} \sim N(F^*_{itk}, \phi)\\
F^*_{itk} = \beta_k C_{it} - \alpha_{tk}
\end{gather*}

\noindent Where $F$ is the level of the observed fiscal policy variable $k$ in municipality $i$ at time $t$. the distribution of each of these observed variables is drawn from a normally distributed latent variable $F^*$, which has variance $\phi$. $C$ is the quantity of most interest -- the latent fiscal conservatism in that municipality. $\beta$ is the discrimination parameter, which captures how strongly each observed policy variable loads onto the latent dimension. Finally, $\alpha$ represents each item's difficulty parameter, which measures how fiscally conservative a municipality is, if it were to score 0 on the policy variable $k$. (Note that in future iterations, we will allow $\alpha$ to vary across time capturing that what was a highly conservative fiscal policy stance in 1978 is not necessarily as conservative in 2005.)

This parameterization is in many ways similar to frequentist factor analysis. However, a major advantage to using Bayesian techniques to make inferences about the latent trait is that the simulations will impute missing data during the estimation, which will allow us to include variables with different numbers of observations in the model -- the variables with missing observations will simply supply less information to the estimation. Furthermore, we can use the Bayesian priors to introduce dynamics into the model, thus allowing quantities to not only vary across time, but also directly model temporal autocorrelation. This is what allow policies which we have no information on in year $t$ to influence our estimate of policy conservatism in this year. Additionally, the estimation is simulation based, which allows us to directly estimate uncertainty around all model parameters. Finally, constraining prior distributions offers a flexible way of identifying the policy space. More on this final point later.

We include the 14 policy variables into the model. Before we do so, all variables are rescaled to have mean zero and variance one. Furthermore, all variables where higher values imply a more left-wing fiscal policy are reversed. This implies that when estimating policy conservatism, higher values on all variables indicate a more conservative policy.\footnote{This is strictly speaking not necessary, but it makes interpretation of the model parameters simpler.}

To identify the direction of the policy space, we constrain the $\beta$'s to be positive, so that municipalities scoring higher on our observed policy variables will be estimated to be more conservative. Location and scale is identified by placing standard normal priors on the distributions of all model parameters (hvad betyder dette?).

In our estimation, we run 7,500 iterations of the model, where the first 2,500 are burn in. We run three parallel chains. This gave posterior distributions with good properties (i.e., ?? ).

Figure \ref{fig:descriptive} presents some descriptive features of the resulting measure. In particular, it looks at how the measure is distributed across time and space, revealing some interesting patterns in municipal fiscal policy.
